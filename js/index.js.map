Plugins might want to do this, so that they can use event\n * dispatching as a tool that helps them decide which events should be extracted\n * in the first place.\n *\n * \"On-Demand-Dispatched Events\":\n *\n * - On-demand-dispatched events are not returned from `extractEvents`.\n * - On-demand-dispatched events are dispatched during the process of returning\n *   the deferred-dispatched events.\n * - They should not have side effects.\n * - They should be avoided, and/or eventually be replaced with another\n *   abstraction that allows event plugins to perform multiple \"rounds\" of event\n *   extraction.\n *\n * Therefore, the sequence of event dispatches becomes:\n *\n * - `R`s on-demand events (if any)   (dispatched by `R` on-demand)\n * - `S`s on-demand events (if any)   (dispatched by `S` on-demand)\n * - `C`s on-demand events (if any)   (dispatched by `C` on-demand)\n * - `R`s extracted events (if any)   (dispatched by `EventPluginHub`)\n * - `S`s extracted events (if any)   (dispatched by `EventPluginHub`)\n * - `C`s extracted events (if any)   (dispatched by `EventPluginHub`)\n *\n * In the case of `ResponderEventPlugin`: If the `startShouldSetResponder`\n * on-demand dispatch returns `true` (and some other details are satisfied) the\n * `onResponderGrant` deferred dispatched event is returned from\n * `extractEvents`. The sequence of dispatch executions in this case\n * will appear as follows:\n *\n * - `startShouldSetResponder` (`ResponderEventPlugin` dispatches on-demand)\n * - `touchStartCapture`       (`EventPluginHub` dispatches as usual)\n * - `touchStart`              (`EventPluginHub` dispatches as usual)\n * - `responderGrant/Reject`   (`EventPluginHub` dispatches as usual)\n *\n * @param {string} topLevelType Record from `EventConstants`.\n * @param {string} topLevelTargetID ID of deepest React rendered element.\n * @param {object} nativeEvent Native browser event.\n * @return {*} An accumulation of synthetic events.\n */\nfunction setResponderAndExtractTransfer(\n    topLevelType,\n    topLevelTargetID,\n    nativeEvent) {\n  var shouldSetEventType =\n    isStartish(topLevelType) ? eventTypes.startShouldSetResponder :\n    isMoveish(topLevelType) ? eventTypes.moveShouldSetResponder :\n    eventTypes.scrollShouldSetResponder;\n\n  var bubbleShouldSetFrom = responderID || topLevelTargetID;\n  var shouldSetEvent = SyntheticEvent.getPooled(\n    shouldSetEventType,\n    bubbleShouldSetFrom,\n    nativeEvent\n  );\n  EventPropagators.accumulateTwoPhaseDispatches(shouldSetEvent);\n  var wantsResponderID = executeDispatchesInOrderStopAtTrue(shouldSetEvent);\n  if (!shouldSetEvent.isPersistent()) {\n    shouldSetEvent.constructor.release(shouldSetEvent);\n  }\n\n  if (!wantsResponderID || wantsResponderID === responderID) {\n    return null;\n  }\n  var extracted;\n  var grantEvent = SyntheticEvent.getPooled(\n    eventTypes.responderGrant,\n    wantsResponderID,\n    nativeEvent\n  );\n\n  EventPropagators.accumulateDirectDispatches(grantEvent);\n  if (responderID) {\n    var terminationRequestEvent = SyntheticEvent.getPooled(\n      eventTypes.responderTerminationRequest,\n      responderID,\n      nativeEvent\n    );\n    EventPropagators.accumulateDirectDispatches(terminationRequestEvent);\n    var shouldSwitch = !hasDispatches(terminationRequestEvent) ||\n      executeDirectDispatch(terminationRequestEvent);\n    if (!terminationRequestEvent.isPersistent()) {\n      terminationRequestEvent.constructor.release(terminationRequestEvent);\n    }\n\n    if (shouldSwitch) {\n      var terminateType = eventTypes.responderTerminate;\n      var terminateEvent = SyntheticEvent.getPooled(\n        terminateType,\n        responderID,\n        nativeEvent\n      );\n      EventPropagators.accumulateDirectDispatches(terminateEvent);\n      extracted = accumulateInto(extracted, [grantEvent, terminateEvent]);\n      responderID = wantsResponderID;\n    } else {\n      var rejectEvent = SyntheticEvent.getPooled(\n        eventTypes.responderReject,\n        wantsResponderID,\n        nativeEvent\n      );\n      EventPropagators.accumulateDirectDispatches(rejectEvent);\n      extracted = accumulateInto(extracted, rejectEvent);\n    }\n  } else {\n    extracted = accumulateInto(extracted, grantEvent);\n    responderID = wantsResponderID;\n  }\n  return extracted;\n}\n\n/**\n * A transfer is a negotiation between a currently set responder and the next\n * element to claim responder status.
